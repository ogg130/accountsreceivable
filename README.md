Front End:
  React.Js 
  Google Material-UI
  React-Data-Grid
My first crack at a real React.js UI. I think this is the best work I have ever done, visually. The code could use some work :D
  
Back End:
  C# .netCore 
  6 microservices with REST APIs
  Entity Framework
  
Loads of good stuff within! Password salting and hashing, REST API basic authentication, response deserialization, httpclient usage...
